Exercise 0.6 New note

1. In firefox developer edition, the _Network_ tab shows all 5 `GET` requests plus the `POST` request instead of just one `POST` as is written in this tutorial, my guess is that the _Network_ tab keeps the old records and adds a new one when the button is clicked, and I can validate it by submit more than once.
2. Another note is that there're only 99 notes stored in the server's data.json file, but on the single page app, a user can add multiple notes without refreshing the page to get the latest data, so that the total notes can exceed 100, which is different from the traditional way of form submitting (can't exceed 100 notes).
